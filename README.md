Sentiment-Driven Market Insight & Decision Analysis

Transforming unstructured emotional data into actionable insights for decision-making and growth strategy.

📌 Overview

This project demonstrates how sentiment analysis can be used as an analytical decision-support tool, rather than a purely technical ML task.
It focuses on extracting behavioral and emotional signals from unstructured text and translating them into business-relevant insights.

The workflow mirrors real-world analyst and consulting scenarios where raw data is analyzed, interpreted, and converted into strategic conclusions.

🎯 Problem Statement

Textual data such as news headlines, market commentary, and public opinion contains strong emotional signals that influence behavior and outcomes.
However, these signals are unstructured, noisy, and difficult to quantify.

Goal:
Analyze sentiment patterns in text data and demonstrate how emotional signals can complement quantitative metrics to support strategic decision-making and risk awareness.

✅ Key Objectives
